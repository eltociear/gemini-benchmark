Frank took 664 days to finish the book. Since we are asked for the number of chapters he read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the number of days.\n\nThere are 2 chapters in the book, and it took him 664 days to read them. So, he read 2 chapters / 664 days = 0.00301204819277108433734939759036 chapters per day. Since we typically don't read a fraction of a chapter, we can round this to the nearest whole number or provide it as a fraction. Rounded to the nearest thousandth, Frank read approximately 0.003 chapters per day. However, since it's not practical to read a fraction of a chapter, we can say that some days he read no chapters, and on others, he read one or more chapters to complete the book in 664 days.", "answer": "332.0", "is_correct": 0, "is_correct_last": 0, "predict": "664", "predict_last": "664"}

Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches. However, since it's not possible to have a negative number of peaches, there must be a mistake in the interpretation of the information.\n\nLet's correct this: If Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill, and Jake has 7 peaches, then Jill has 7 - 18 = -11 peaches, which is not possible. We need to add instead of subtract because Jake has more peaches than Jill. So, Jill has 7 - 18 = -11, but to correct this, we should calculate Jill's peaches as 7 - (-18) = 7 + 18 = 25 peaches.\n\nNow, to find out how many more peaches Steven has than Jill, we subtract the number of peaches Jill has from the number of peaches Steven has: 16 - 25 = -9. This result would suggest that Jill has 9 more peaches than Steven, which contradicts the initial statement that Jake has fewer peaches than Steven.\n\nThe correct calculation should be: Steven has 16 peaches, and Jill has 7 peaches (since Jake has 18 more than Jill and Jake has 7 peaches).
